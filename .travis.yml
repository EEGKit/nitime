# Multiple lines can be made a single "virtual line" because of the way that
# Travis munges each line before executing it to print out the exit status.
# It's okay for it to be on multiple physical lines, so long as you remember:
# - There can't be any leading "-"s - All newlines will be removed, so use
# ";"s
